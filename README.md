# Object Detection in Images(OpenCV)

## About
This is 1 of 3 notebooks that will be available for trial and have fun with.
The next 2 are Object detection in [videos](https://github.com/deep28vish/Object-detection-Videos-OpenCV) 2/3 and in [webcams](https://github.com/deep28vish/Object-Detection-Webcam-OpenCV) 3/3.
These are sample codes ready to run without any prior knowledge of AI, ML DNN, CNN these 50 lines are just plain simple ready to run.

## Requirements
* [Opencv(cv2)](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)
* [Cascade classifiers](https://github.com/deep28vish/Object-Detection-Images-OpenCV/tree/master/haar_cascades)
## Contents
* haar_cascades[Folder with all the required classifiers]
* Object_detection_images.py
* Sample_input_images:
    * cr02.png
    * crowd1.jpg
* Sample_output_images:
    * eyes_faces.png

## Inspiration
* [SENTDEX](https://pythonprogramming.net/)

## Takeaway
This is just to see how to load classifiers and execute it using OPENCV in python.
